### 🎯 Team Learning Goal

Nobody needs to master an entire technology before contributing. Each
member should learn enough to **understand, build, modify, test, and
explain** the part they are responsible for.

## 💻 Installation

Clone the repository:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/yash-data-tools/Health-Assistant.git
cd health-assistant-ai
```

### Backend

``` bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
```

Windows:

``` bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Linux/macOS:

``` bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

``` bash
cd ./backend/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run Flask:

``` bash
cd ./backend/
python app.py
```

### Frontend

Open another terminal:

``` bash
cd ./Health-Assistance/
npm install
npm run dev
```

The terminal will show the local React/Vite URL.

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Never upload API keys to GitHub.

Create a local `.env` file when required:

``` env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Add the following to `.gitignore`:

``` text
.env
venv/
__pycache__/
node_modules/
*.pyc
```

## 🔄 How It Works

``` text
User
  ↓
React Frontend
  ↓
Flask Backend
  ├──→ AI API → Health Analysis
  ├──→ C Program → BMI Calculation
  └──→ SQLite3 → Consultation History
```

For example, a user can enter:

``` text
I have a headache and fever.
```

The frontend sends the request to Flask. Flask communicates with the AI
API and receives structured information such as:

``` json
{
  "data": {
    "Symptoms": "headache and fever",
    "advice": [
      "Stay hydrated",
      "Take adequate rest"
    ],
    "doctor": "General Physician",
    "possibleCauses": [
      "Viral infection",
      "Tension headache"
    ],
    "severity": "Moderate"
  }
}
```

The result can then be displayed to the user and saved in SQLite for the
History page.

## 🗄️ Database

SQLite3 is used to store consultation results.

Possible fields include:

-   Consultation ID
-   Symptoms
-   AI response
-   Advice
-   Possible causes
-   Recommended doctor
-   Severity
-   Date/time

## 🔌 API

Example Flask endpoints:

``` text
POST /api/health
GET  /api/results
DELETE /api/results/<id>
POST /api/bmi
```

The exact endpoints may change during development.

## 🌿 Git & GitHub Workflow

Everyone should work on their own branch.

Create a branch:

``` bash
git checkout -b feature/your-name
```

Example:

``` bash
git checkout -b feature/ritoja-history
```

After making changes:

``` bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add history page UI"
git push origin feature/ritoja-history
```

Then open a **Pull Request** on GitHub.

### ⚠️ Do not directly push major changes to `main`.

The `main` branch should remain the stable version.

## 📌 Contribution Rules

Before coding:

1.  Pull the latest changes.
2.  Check what other members are working on.
3.  Create your own branch.
4.  Understand the existing code before changing it.

While coding:

-   Use meaningful names.
-   Keep code simple.
-   Don't unnecessarily rewrite another member's work.
-   Don't delete working code without discussing it.
-   Keep reusable components separate.
-   Ask when you don't understand something.

Before pushing:

-   Test your feature.
-   Make sure frontend and backend still run.
-   Check that existing features still work.
-   Remove debug code.
-   Never commit API keys, passwords, or `.env` files.

> If you don't understand something, ask before changing it. It's much
> better than accidentally breaking the backend and having everyone
> stare at the screen like **💀**.

## 🧪 Testing

Test multiple inputs, for example:

``` text
I have a headache.
```

``` text
I have fever and cough.
```

``` text
I have severe chest pain.
```

Check that the application:

-   Accepts input.
-   Returns a response.
-   Displays the response correctly.
-   Handles errors.
-   Saves history when appropriate.
-   Does not crash with unexpected input.

## 📚 Learning Plan

The team has approximately **2 months** to learn the required
technologies.

### 🟢 Easy

-   Basic HTML
-   Basic CSS
-   Required page/component design
-   Basic Git/GitHub

### 🟡 Normal

-   Python fundamentals
-   Flask routes
-   Request/response handling
-   SQLite3 basics
-   Frontend/backend communication

### 🔴 Hard

-   JavaScript fundamentals
-   React components
-   Props
-   State
-   Events
-   API requests
-   Basic project integration

You don't need to learn 100% of a technology. Learn what the project
needs first, then expand your knowledge.

## ⚠️ Medical Safety

This is an **educational software project**, not a medical diagnostic
system.

AI responses should not be presented as confirmed diagnoses. Users
should seek professional medical care for severe, worsening, or
potentially dangerous symptoms.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The goal is to learn how a real software project is developed as a team:

``` text
Learn
  ↓
Build
  ↓
Test
  ↓
Commit
  ↓
Pull Request
  ↓
Review
  ↓
Merge
  ↓
Improve
```

Everyone should understand their own contribution well enough to explain
it during the project presentation.
